Please come in! 🍻","tags":["dino-space-dive","me"],"slug":"welcome","content":"import ImgCenteredMd from \"@components/ui/ImgCenteredMd.astro\";\n\n\n\nHello, my fellow space-dinos! Welcome to the amazing DinoSpaceDive! The coolest\nbar in cyber-space, designed for all the tech-dinos out there!\n\nI’m Alejandro, your host and owner. It’s so great to have you on board!\n\nThis blog is an amazing place where I get to share my little knowledge on\ndifferent topics, technologies, cyber-security and automation. I also get to\nhave a lot of fun sharing random things about myself and my life.\n\nThis is not a professional blog by any means! Instead, it is a place where I can\nshare my knowledge and experiences in a unique way.\n\n## What to Expect from this Blog\n\nHere is a list of the things I’ll be writing about in this blog:\n\n- AppSec: Things like Secure Coding, Web Application Security, DevSecOps, and so\n  on. _(future AppSec Engineer in progress)_\n\n- Other Cyber-security topics: Hacking, Triage, Bug Bounty and CTFs.\n\n- Programming and Automation: Python, Bash, Web Development and Chrome\n  Extensions.\n\n- Computer and Mac Automation Tips. I love finding better and faster ways to do\n  things on my computer.\n\n- A little about my life and trips.\n\nAs you can see, it’s a bit of everything. Who knows what I’ll be writing about\nin the future? _(I don’t even know yet!)_\n\n## A little about Me\n\nI was born in the Canary Islands in Spain, and I love living here!\n\nSince I was young, I have really enjoyed playing sports. I played\nfootball/soccer, tennis and athletics for a while. I still play futsal _(indoor\nfootball)_ in a team now. Every year, I try to go snowboarding or skiing as it\nis so fun that I got addicted to it.\n\nI also like to travel a lot with my family and friends. What excites me most\nabout travelling is discovering and finding unknown places in nature, such as\nmountains, beaches, waterfalls, rivers, lakes and valleys.\n\nI’m a bit of a geek and I used to love playing video games on any console, such\nas the DS, PS2, PSP, Wii or on any other computer.\n\n### My unexpected career path\n\nI have been interested in computers since I was a teenager _(downloading movies\nand music, and pirating my PSP and NDS)_. I didn’t really get into programming\nuntil I started my bachelor’s degree. Since then, I have become immersed in the\nworld of programming and automation. I really like the fact that you can solve\nproblems in your own way of thinking.\n\nRight now, I’m the kind of person who would rather spend 20 hours automating\nsomething that could have taken me 10 hours to do manually 🤖.\n\nOnce I had finished my Bachelor’s degree, I took a break to think properly about\nwhat I would like to work on in the future. Although I enjoy programming, I want\nto find a job that I will enjoy in the long term.\n\nWhile watching Mr. Robot, I realised that although my degree had taught me a lot\nabout programming, I still didn’t really understand how computers, the internet\nand the web worked. I could not grasp what the main characters were doing to\nhack into the computers. So I decided to learn more about it.\n\nDuring this time, I learnt much more about computers than I did during my\nbachelor’s degree. It was less about passing an exam and more about\nunderstanding how computers and the internet work in the real world.\n\nI decided to put my knowledge into the test by taking the OSCP exam. After a\nyear and a half of studying hacking, I finally passed the OSCP. Then I got a job\nin cybersecurity at Hexod, working as part of the Salesforce triage team. If you\nwant to know more about my career path, just take a look at the timeline on the\n[homepage](/).\n\n---\n\n<ImgCenteredMd src=\"/images/thatsall\" alt=\"Thas's all Folks!\" />\n\nThat’s all folks! Now, you know what to expect from this blog and know me a bit.\n\nOops! I almost forgot to tell you.. So you know, I am a cool and fast\nVelociraptor.\n\nPlease come in and let me know below what kind of dino are you! 🦖"}]
