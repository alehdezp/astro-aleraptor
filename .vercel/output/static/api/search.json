The\ncoolest bar in cyber-space, designed for all the tech-dinos out there!\n\nI‚Äôm Alejandro, your host and owner. It‚Äôs so great to have you on board!\n\n<Image src={spaceBar} alt=\"Space Bar\" loading=\"eager\" />\n\nThis blog is an amazing place where I get to share my little knowledge on\ndifferent topics, technologies, cyber-security and automation. I also get to\nhave a lot of fun sharing random things about myself and my life.\n\nThis is not a professional blog by any means! Instead, it is a place where I can\nshare my knowledge and experiences in a unique way.\n\n## What to Expect from this Blog\n\nHere is a list of the things I‚Äôll be writing about in this blog:\n\n- AppSec: Things like Secure Coduing, Web Application Security, DevSecOps, and\n  so on. _(future AppSec Engineer in progress)_\n- Other Cyber-security topics: Hacking, Triage, Bug Bounty and CTFs.\n- Programming and Automation: Python, Bash, Web Development and Chrome\n  Extensions.\n- Computer and Mac Automation Tips. I love finding better and faster ways to do\n  things on my computer.\n- A little about my life and trips.\n\nAs you can see, it‚Äôs a bit of everything. Who knows what I‚Äôll be writing about\nin the future? _(I don‚Äôt even know yet!)_\n\n## A little about Me (for those interested)\n\nI was born in the beautiful Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago near Africa. I\nreally like living here. The people and weather is amazing, and each island has\nits own unique charm ‚Äî especially _El Hierro_.\n\n\n\nSince I was young, I have really enjoyed playing sports. I played\nfootball/soccer, tennis and athletics for a while. I still play futsal _(indoor\nfootball)_ in a team now. Every year, I try to go snowboarding or skiing as it\nis so fun that I got addicted to it.\n\nI also like to travel a lot with my family and friends. What excites me most\nabout travelling is discovering and finding unknown places in nature, such as\nmountains, beaches, waterfalls, rivers, lakes and valleys.\n\nI‚Äôm a bit of a geek and I used to love playing video games on any console, such\nas the DS, PS2, PSP, Wii or on any other computer.\n\n### My unexpected career path\n\nI have been interested in computers since I was a teenager _(downloading movies\nand music, and pirating my PSP and NDS)_. I didn‚Äôt really get into programming\nuntil I started my bachelor‚Äôs degree. Since then, I have become immersed in the\nworld of programming and automation. I really like the fact that you can solve\nproblems in your own way of thinking.\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm the kind of person who would rather spend 20 hours automating\nsomething that could have taken me 10 hours to do manually ü§ñ.\n\n<ImgMD src=\"/images/cat-miope\" alt=\"Cat Hacking\" astro_enabled={false} />\n\nOnce I had finished my Bachelor‚Äôs degree, I took a break to think properly about\nwhat I would like to work on in the future. Although I enjoy programming, I want\nto find a job that I will enjoy in the long term.\n\nWhile watching Mr. Robot show, I realised that although my degree had taught me\na lot about programming, I still didn‚Äôt really understand how computers, the\ninternet and the web worked. I could not grasp what the main characters were\ndoing to hack into the computers. So I decided to learn more about it.\n\nDuring this time, I learnt much more about computers than I did during my\nbachelor‚Äôs degree. It was less about passing an exam and more about\nunderstanding how computers and the internet work in the real world.\n\nI decided to put my knowledge into the test by taking the OSCP exam. After a\nyear and a half of studying hacking, I finally passed the OSCP. Then I got a job\nin cybersecurity at Hexod, working as part of the Salesforce triage team. If you\nwant to know more about my career path, just take a look at the timeline on the\n[homepage](/).\n\n---\n\nThat‚Äôs all folks! Now, you know what to expect from this blog and know me a bit.\n\nOops! I almost forgot to tell you.. So you know, I am a cool and fast\nVelociraptor.\n\nPlease come in and let me know below what kind of dino are you! ü¶ñ"}]
